# Coding Question
Create a TV show watchlist HTML page. There should be a form with a text field for the title, a select field for the rating from 1-5, and an input for the status: watched, watching, plan on watching, dropped. These should be 3 different forms of input. There should be a clear button. Below the form should be a list displaying all of the shows with the title, rating and status. Each item in the list should be color coded based on status.
